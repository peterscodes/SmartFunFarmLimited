                <h1>Pineapple</h1>
                <p>
                    The 'Red Spanish' cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines. The long 
leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional piña fibers, an adaptation of the native weaving 
traditions with fibers extracted from abacá. These were woven into lustrous lace-like nipis fabrics usually 
decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado. The fabric was a luxury export 
from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the 
18th and 19th centuries. Domestically, they were used to make the traditional barong Tagalog, baro't saya, 
and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class, as well as women's kerchiefs (pañuelo). They were 
favored for their light and breezy quality, which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands. The 
industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived.[34][35][40] 
Nutrition 
Raw pineapple pulp is 86% water, 13% carbohydrates, 0.5% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a 
100-gram reference amount, raw pineapple supplies 50 calories, and is a rich source of manganese (44% 
Daily Value, DV) and vitamin C (58% DV), but otherwise contains no micronutrients in significant 
amounts.[41] 
Prevents Constipation: As with a wide variety of other fruits, pineapple prevents constipation. It may 
also relieve constipation once you already have it. The main reason is because pineapple does contain fiber 
which helps with regulation. 
Contains Several Nutrients: Apart from fiber, there are many other essential nutrients and vitamins that can 
be found in pineapple. This includes Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Calcium, and Potassium. 
Provide relief from cold and cough: Pineapple contains what is called bromelain, which is known to relieve 
or even stop cold and coughs altogether. The main reason is because it is anti-inflammatory and ultimately, 
it is known to help with the loosening of mucus.
